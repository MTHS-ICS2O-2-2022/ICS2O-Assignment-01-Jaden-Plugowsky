            - Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer, this is
            because she detailed an algorithm specifically created for a machine
            to perform.
            <br />
            <br />
            - She wrote about a computer which was never built, the “Analytical
            Engine”, which she designed with Charles Babbage, an English
            Polymath. She helped translate a paper written by Luigi Menabrea, an
            Italian mathematician and politician, on Babbage's Analytical Engine
            from French to English, and with it, she added many annotations on
            extra uses for it, along with other notes about it.
            <br />
            <br />
            - She is credited with being the first person to realise that
            computers can be used for purposes other than simply to calculate
            mathematical, such as creating music and art

            - She was born to Lord and Lady Byron on 10 December, 1815, London,
            England. She died November 27, 1852, at the very young age of 36
            years old, she had died due to Uterine cancer
            <br />
            <br />
            - She was taught mathematics from a young age, especially after her
            father left due to an extramarital affair. Her mother wanted her not
            to follow in her father's footsteps, and so she taught her
            mathematics to avoid the “romantic ideals” and “moody nature” of her
            father.
            <br />
            <br />
            - She met Charles Babbage at the age of 17 through their mutual
            friend Mary Somerville. He demonstrated to her a portion of his
            Difference Engine. She became fascinated with the Difference Engine
            and visited Babbage as much as she could.
            <br />
            <br />
            - Charles Darwin read her an excerpt from his book “Dombey and Son”
            while she was at her deathbed. In addition, she was acquainted with
            Michael Faraday, Sir David Brewster, and Mary Somerville, among
            others. Before her death, she had requested to be buried next to her
            father's grave in the Byron family vault, although she had never met
            her father.
